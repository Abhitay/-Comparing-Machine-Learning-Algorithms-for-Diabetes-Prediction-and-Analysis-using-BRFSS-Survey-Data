# About
#### Diabetes is a chronic disease that affects the way the body processes blood sugar. It is characterized by high levels of sugar in the blood, which can lead to serious health complications if left untreated. One way to diagnose diabetes is using machine learning techniques applied to the data collected from human blood samples. 
#### In this research paper, we explore the different machine learning algorithms to identify the presence of diabetes in a patient based on dataset created by BRFSS, in the year 2015, then we pre-process the data to prepare it for analysis, this step includes tasks such as cleaning and normalizing the data.
#### Next step involves the training of a machine learning model on the pre-processed dataset. This process involves the selection of the machine learning algorithms and optimizing them, the modelâ€™s performance is evaluated on an unseen selection of data. 
#### Finally, we discuss the obtained results and their implications of using machine learning techniques for the diagnosis of diabetes.
